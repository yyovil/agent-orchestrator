Spawn parallel AI coding agents, each in its own git worktree, on a single machine. Agents autonomously fix CI failures, address review comments, and open PRs — you supervise the whole fleet from one dashboard.

**Agent-agnostic** (Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Cursor, OpenCode) · **Runtime-agnostic** (tmux, ConPTY/process, Docker) · **Tracker-agnostic** (GitHub, Linear, GitLab)

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @aoagents/ao
```

> **Nightly builds** (latest `main`): `npm install -g @aoagents/ao@nightly` — back to stable with `@latest`.

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js 20.18.3+](https://nodejs.org), [Git 2.25+](https://git-scm.com), the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com), and at least one coding-agent CLI (e.g. [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)).

- **macOS / Linux:** [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) — `brew install tmux` or `sudo apt install tmux`.
- **Windows:** PowerShell 7+ recommended; tmux is **not** required (AO uses native ConPTY via the `process` runtime).

## Quick start

Point it at any repo — it clones, configures, and launches the dashboard in one command:

```bash
ao start https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
```

Or from inside an existing local repo:

```bash
cd ~/your-project && ao start
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:3000` and an orchestrator agent starts managing your project. Add more repos any time:

```bash
ao start ~/path/to/another-repo
```

You don't need to learn the CLI — the dashboard and the orchestrator agent drive everything. (Individual `ao` commands are documented in the [CLI Reference](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/docs/CLI.md) and used internally by the orchestrator.)

## How it works

1. **You start** — `ao start` launches the dashboard and an orchestrator agent.
2. **Orchestrator spawns workers** — each issue gets its own agent in an isolated git worktree and branch.
3. **Agents work autonomously** — they read code, write tests, and open PRs.
4. **Reactions handle feedback** — CI failures and review comments are routed back to the responsible agent automatically.
5. **You review and merge** — you're pulled in only when human judgment is needed.

## Pluggable by design

Seven plugin slots; the lifecycle state machine stays in core:

| Slot | Default | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | tmux (macOS/Linux) / process (Windows) | process, docker |
| Agent | claude-code | codex, aider, cursor, opencode, kimicode |
| Workspace | worktree | clone |
| Tracker | github | linear, gitlab |
| SCM | github | gitlab |
| Notifier | desktop | slack, discord, composio, webhook, openclaw |
| Terminal | iterm2 | web |

## Why Agent Orchestrator?

Running one AI agent in a terminal is easy. Running 30 across different issues, branches, and PRs is a coordination problem: creating branches, detecting stuck agents, reading CI failures, forwarding review comments, tracking which PRs are ready, and cleaning up afterward.

Agent Orchestrator handles the isolation, feedback routing, and status tracking. You `ao start` and walk away — then review PRs and make decisions. The rest is automated.
